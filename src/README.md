# Clone the project

# In the project directory run

## npm install

#In the project directory run:

### `npm start`

#API is working. you can see it in console log
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Api call was successfull. I was trying to pass the data in redux ##initial state.

i wrote new reducers, actions.

## It then needed a middleware, installed redux-thunk,

now everything was working. but redux couldn't figure out the dispatch to call the api.
so the data from the api i coundn't show using redux.
so i kept the code, but shown the hardcoded data to use,
As time was very short,
Thanks for the opportunity to test my skill.
